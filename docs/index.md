- **Message Protocol**: Binary-serialized protocol buffers
- **State Management**: Distributed state with eventual consistency

### Performance Features
- Zero-copy message passing
- Lock-free concurrency
- Optimized async I/O
- Minimal memory footprint

## System Requirements

## Architecture Note

Ceylon implements a pure P2P networking solution using libp2p Rust implementation. While using similar distributed networking principles as BitTorrent, it operates independently of any blockchain technology. The system provides autonomous agent communication through a high-performance P2P network layer.
